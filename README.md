## Q&A

### What's this ?

A modern, beautiful and efficient online Steam Workshop badges generator that generates beautiful Workshop badges in one click.

Thanks to the services provided by [shields.io](https://shields.io/), the generated badges dynamically displays Workshop data such as the number of subscribers, downloads and file size. You can quickly generate the `BBCode` used by Steam and embed it in the Workshop profile.

### How to use this tool?

1. Go to the Badges Generator page, enter the address of your workshop item, and click "Generate BBCode" to get the code.
2. Click "Copy All" to copy the code to your clipboard.

3. Go to the Steam Workshop item profile page and fill in the generated code in the profile field.

### What should I be aware of?

- The generated code does not apply to places like Steam Guide, personal profiles, and so on.
- Not all syntax in the editor applies to Steam, such as centering.

- The style of the badges generated by this generator is fixed. To generate more personalized badges , you can fork this project on Github and deploy your own.
